# Slither Report

After installing Slither, you can generate a report in the command line interface (CMD) using various commands and options. Here's how you can utilize Slither for analyzing Solidity code:

1. **Ignoring Values in Slither:**
   To disable a specific line or section in Slither, you can use the following command:

- Slither-disable-next-line [detector_name]

Replace `[detector_name]` with the name of the detector you want to skip or ignore.

2. **Handling Low Findings:**
Slither identifies low findings based on certain events in your code:
- If an event is missing or can be manipulated, it's considered low.
- If an event is incorrect, it's also classified as low.

3. **Solidity Version and Assembly:**
Slither prefers certain coding practices:
- Avoid using assembly whenever possible.
- Use pragma solidity with a fixed version instead of floating version.
- Ensure you're using the latest version of Solidity and avoid older versions.

4. **Excluding Dependencies from Libraries:**
You can exclude dependencies from libraries using the `exclude-dependencies` option:

- Slither . --exclude-dependencies
