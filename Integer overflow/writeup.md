## [S-004] Integer Underflow/Overflow Vulnerability in `PuppyRaffle` Contract (Root: Data Type Limitations + Impact: Loss of Funds)

### Description:
The `PuppyRaffle` contract is susceptible to integer underflow/overflow vulnerabilities due to data type limitations, specifically related to the use of `uint` and `int` types. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, when the maximum value of a data type is reached, it wraps around to zero, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and loss of funds. This vulnerability arises from the inherent limitations of data types and their behavior in arithmetic operations.

### Impact:
The integer underflow/overflow vulnerability poses significant risks to the `PuppyRaffle` contract and its participants. If exploited, it can result in the loss of funds and undermine the integrity and functionality of the contract. In the context of a raffle system, unexpected behavior due to data type limitations can lead to unfair outcomes and erode trust among users.

### Exploit Scenario:
An attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating input values or triggering arithmetic operations that exceed the maximum value of `uint` or `int` types. This manipulation causes unexpected behavior, such as wrapping around to zero or unintended arithmetic results, leading to financial loss or unfair advantages in the raffle.

### Recommended Mitigation:
To mitigate the integer underflow/overflow vulnerability in the `PuppyRaffle` contract, the following measures are recommended:

1. **Upgrade to Solidity 0.8.0 or Above**: Solidity versions 0.8.0 and above default to "checked" arithmetic operations, where transactions revert on integer overflow. Upgrading to these versions helps prevent unintended behavior resulting from integer overflow.

2. **Use Bigger Data Types**: Utilize larger data types, such as `uint256` or `int256`, to accommodate larger values and reduce the likelihood of reaching the maximum value of the data type.

3. **Implement Range Checks**: Incorporate range checks in critical areas of the contract to ensure that arithmetic operations stay within acceptable bounds and prevent integer underflow/overflow.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the `PuppyRaffle` contract can enhance its robustness and resilience against integer underflow/overflow vulnerabilities, thereby safeguarding user funds and maintaining the integrity of the raffle system.

## [S-005] Precision Loss Issue in `PuppyRaffle` Contract (Root: Data Type Precision + Impact: Inaccuracy)

### Description:
The `PuppyRaffle` contract is susceptible to precision loss issues, particularly in scenarios involving arithmetic operations with high precision requirements. This vulnerability arises from the limitations of data type precision, which can lead to inaccuracies and loss of precision in calculations involving decimal values, such as token balances or fee calculations.

### Impact:
The precision loss issue can have significant implications for the `PuppyRaffle` contract, especially in cases where precise calculations are crucial for fairness and accuracy. Inaccurate calculations may result in incorrect token balances, fee distributions, or other critical parameters, leading to inconsistencies and distrust among participants.

### Exploit Scenario:
An attacker exploits the precision loss vulnerability by manipulating input values or triggering arithmetic operations that involve high precision calculations. By exploiting the inherent limitations of data type precision, the attacker can introduce inaccuracies into critical calculations, potentially gaining unfair advantages or causing financial losses to other participants.

### Recommended Mitigation:
To mitigate the precision loss issue in the `PuppyRaffle` contract, the following measures are recommended:

1. **Use Fixed-Point Arithmetic**: Implement fixed-point arithmetic libraries or techniques to handle decimal values with precision, ensuring accurate calculations without loss of precision.

2. **Avoid Floating-Point Arithmetic**: Avoid using floating-point arithmetic operations, as they are prone to precision loss issues due to the binary representation of floating-point numbers.

3. **Test with Realistic Scenarios**: Conduct thorough testing with realistic scenarios and edge cases to identify and address potential precision loss issues before deployment.

By adopting these mitigation strategies, the `PuppyRaffle` contract can mitigate the risk of precision loss and ensure accurate calculations, enhancing the fairness and reliability of the raffle system.

## [S-006] Integer Overflow Mitigation in `PuppyRaffle` Contract (Root: Data Type Constraints + Impact: Transaction Reversion)

### Description:
The `PuppyRaffle` contract faces the risk of integer overflow, especially when dealing with `uint256` data types that may exceed their maximum value. In Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, integer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, such as wrapping around to zero, potentially causing financial losses or disrupting contract functionality.

### Impact:
Integer overflow poses a significant risk to the `PuppyRaffle` contract, as it can result in unintended consequences such as incorrect calculations, loss of funds, or transaction reversion. The impact of integer overflow can undermine the reliability and functionality of the contract, leading to user dissatisfaction and loss of trust.

### Exploit Scenario:
An attacker exploits the integer overflow vulnerability by manipulating input values or triggering arithmetic operations that exceed
