### Recommended Mitigation: There are a few recommended mitigations here.
- Use a newer version of Solidity that does not allow integer overflows by default.
```diff
- pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
+ pragma solidity ^0.8.18;
```

- Alternatively, if you want to use an older version of Solidity, you can use a library like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to prevent integer overflows.
- Use a uint256 instead of a uint64 for totalFees.
```diff
- uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+ uint256 public totalFees = 0;
```

- Remove the balance check in PuppyRaffle::withdrawFees
```diff
- require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```

Unsafe Casting Write Up

### [M-3] Unsafe cast of `PuppyRaffle::fee` loses fees

**Description:** In `PuppyRaffle::selectWinner` their is a type cast of a `uint256` to a `uint64`. This is an unsafe cast, and if the `uint256` is larger than `type(uint64).max`, the value will be truncated.

```javascript
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length > 0, "PuppyRaffle: No players in raffle");

        uint256 winnerIndex = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 fee = totalFees / 10;
        uint256 winnings = address(this).balance - fee;
@>      totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
        players = new address[](0);
        emit RaffleWinner(winner, winnings);
    }
```



The max value of a `uint64` is `18446744073709551615`. In terms of ETH, this is only ~`18` ETH. Meaning, if more than 18ETH of fees are collected, the `fee` casting will truncate the value.

**Impact:** This means the `feeAddress` will not collect the correct amount of fees, leaving fees permanently stuck in the contract.

**Proof of Concept:**

1. A raffle proceeds with a little more than 18 ETH worth of fees collected
2. The line that casts the `fee` as a `uint64` hits
3. `totalFees` is incorrectly updated with a lower amount

You can replicate this in foundry's chisel by running the following:

```javascript
uint256 max = type(uint64).max
uint256 fee = max + 1
uint64(fee)
// prints 0
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Set `PuppyRaffle::totalFees` to a `uint256` instead of a `uint64`, and remove the casting. Their is a comment which says:

```javascript
// We do some storage packing to save gas
```
But the potential gas saved isn't worth it if we have to recast and this bug exists.

```diff
-   uint64 public totalFees = 0;
+   uint256 public totalFees = 0;
.
.
.
    function selectWinner() external {
        require(block.timestamp >= raffleStartTime + raffleDuration, "PuppyRaffle: Raffle not over");
        require(players.length >= 4, "PuppyRaffle: Need at least 4 players");
        uint256 winnerIndex =
            uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.timestamp, block.difficulty))) % players.length;
        address winner = players[winnerIndex];
        uint256 totalAmountCollected = players.length * entranceFee;
        uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
        uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;
-       totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);
+       totalFees = totalFees + fee;
```
