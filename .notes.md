# About 

> About the project in My own words. `SelectWinner` picks the winner, there is a raffle duration

# High
- Found a DoS in `enterRaffle` where loop is involved
- Found a Reentrancy in the  `refund` function 
- overflow in `selectWinner` function

` //@audit overflow classic error due to new version dont allow it
        totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee);`

-  //@audit unsafe castings uint256 to uint64 they will tons of damage to ethe amount 
        totalFees = totalFees + uint64(fee)

- //@audit weak randomness issue
        uint256 rarity = uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, block.difficulty))) % 100;
